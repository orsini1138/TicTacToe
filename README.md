TIC TAC TOE

THE GAME, THE LEGEND

A year ago, when I'd been fucking around with programming for a year and had been working with python for less than 6 months, I'd tried to make a tic tac toe clone and failed because of my win conditions not working. I quit on it pretty quick and went after more "interesting" projects. 

I wanted, now, to make sure I actually could make a basic game like this because it would be pretty bad if I was trying to fuck around with SQL libraries and POS mockups and whatnot and still couldn't make the elementary TTT. 

So here it is, and I'm not offering it to show off or anything, only because I like to keep things posted to my github as motivation and as a progress tracker, something I should have been doing from the start. Here's my 2019 TTT, much shorter and better working than my old attempt.

And yeah there's no option to just play again yet. Oh well.
